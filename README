# gatsby-source-webdav

A plugin for sourcing nodes from a WebDAV directory. Useful for generating static sites from a WebDAV share as a backend, such as Owncloud or Nextcloud.

Please check the version number before you decide to use this in production.

# Developing

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file that brings up a Nextcloud installation to use as a demo share. If desired you can login to the nextcloud instance on http://localhost:8080 using the following credentials:

```
Username: admin
Password: password
```

To see an example Gatsby site that uses the plugin, you can run the following:

> yarn workspace example-site 
> yarn workspace example-site develop

And visit http://localhost:8000. You should see a listing of the demo files provided by Nextcloud.
